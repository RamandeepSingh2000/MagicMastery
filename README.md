# Rogue-Like Adventure Game

A simple rogue-like adventure game built in Unity.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Battle your way through waves of enemies.
- Harvest enemies to gain experience and unlock new skills.
- Choose between upgrading existing skills or selecting new ones.
- Equip your character with items... that don't actually do anything.
- Feeling lazy? Turn on **Godmode** and focus on harvesting instead.

## 🧠 Features

- Skill tree with meaningful (or not-so-meaningful) choices.
- A final boss with an absurd amount of HP — good luck.
- Equipment system purely for aesthetics.
- Godmode for relaxed gameplay or testing.

## 🛠 Development Notes

This project was created as a small college project with 2 other collegues using **Unity**. The focus was on learning core mechanics of rogue-like games and experimenting with upgrade systems.
